/* 
        VOICE CONTROLLED ROBOT USING ARDUINO
        Give your voice commands using the Arduino Bluetooth Voice Controller App.
        HC-04 bluetooth module receives the voice commands sent and sends it to the arduino using UART Serial Communication.
        The received command is stored in a variable "readvoice".
        Based on the command received the inputs to the L293D motor driver are varied and accordingly the motor and hence the robot moves.
